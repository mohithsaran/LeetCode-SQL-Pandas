Leetcode 596
In SQL: 
SELECT class 
FROM
(SELECT 
class, COUNT(student) AS no_of_students
FROM courses
GROUP BY 1)t
WHERE t.no_of_students>=5;

In Pandas:
import pandas as pd

def find_classes(courses: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    count=courses.groupby('class').agg({'student':'count'}).reset_index()
    return count[(count['student']>=5)][['class']]

LeetCode 1484

In SQL: 

select sell_date, count( DISTINCT product ) as num_sold ,
GROUP_CONCAT( DISTINCT product order by product ASC separator ',' ) as products
FROM Activities GROUP BY sell_date order by sell_date ASC;

In Pandas: 

import pandas as pd

def categorize_products(activities: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df=activities.groupby(['sell_date']).agg(num_sold = ('product','nunique'), products = ('product',  lambda x: ','.join(sorted(set(x))))).reset_index()
    return df[['sell_date','num_sold','products']]

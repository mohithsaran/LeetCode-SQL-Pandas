In SQL: Using CTE and Subquery
WITH big_country AS
(SELECT name,population,area
FROM world
WHERE area>=3000000 OR population>=25000000)
SELECT * FROM big_country;

In Pandas: 
import pandas as pd

def big_countries(world: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return world[(world['area']>=3000000)|(world['population']>=25000000)]['name','population','area']]
